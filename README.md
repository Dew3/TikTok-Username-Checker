# TikTok-Username-Checker
Use this to check availability of TikTok usernames.

The program will create two txt files. 

It will then close since if one hasn’t added any names. 

Add usernames to be checked in Usernames.txt (Each username on its own line).

BEWARE! SOME BANNED, DEV, TOO LONG, OR SPECIAL CHARACTER USERNAMES SUCH AS ';Dew3' MAY SAY NOT TAKEN! 

USERNAMES GREATER THAN 24 CHARACTERS ARE NOT CHECKED AS THEY ARE OUT OF TIKTOK’S USERNAME CHARACTER REQUIREMENTS!
